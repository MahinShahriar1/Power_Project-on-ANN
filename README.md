# Power_Project-on-ANN
The project tried to break the limitation barrier of traditional power flow algothrim such as Newton Raphson, Fast Decouple Method etc. With the help of Deep learning model like ANN, power flow measurement of 5 bus system was established. THough dataset was low, still the project can give good predictions of power flow of complex power flow networks.
